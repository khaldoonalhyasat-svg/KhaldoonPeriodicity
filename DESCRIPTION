Description: Implements the Khaldoon periodicity test for detecting periodic
    patterns in time series data. The method combines spectral analysis with
    bootstrap hypothesis testing to identify regular cyclic behaviors while
    controlling for false discoveries. Suitable for applications in finance,
    biology, climate science, and engineering.
